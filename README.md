 ## How to install the required libraries and Run the Server

 - Open your terminal or command prompt.
 - Run the command `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
 - Once the installation is complete, run the command `npm run dev`. This will start the live-server package and launch a development server that serves the contents of the current directory.
